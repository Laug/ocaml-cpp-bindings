ocaml-cpp-bindings
===================

This project illustrates C++ to OCaml bindings.

C++, OCaml and Makefile included.

Simply read the code and run 'make' to build 'a.out'.


A submodule (Dummy.Bindings_caml) calls C++ functions. If you want a simpler example (a module calls C++ functions: compilation is more straightforward) please have a look at the commit tagged 'simpler'.
